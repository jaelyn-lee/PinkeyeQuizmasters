## Description
Pinkeye Quiz Master is a group project that features a simple quiz app with an arcade theme and amusing sound effects to engage users. The front end was my focus, where I rendered the quiz to the page and defined the conditions for correct and incorrect answers. Through this project, I gained a clear understanding of the functionality related to the front end and the data retrieval of the back end. 

Hey, just a friendly heads up that if you play this game too much, you might end up with a case of pink eye. So, take breaks, have fun, and keep those eyes healthy!
